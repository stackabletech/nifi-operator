= Stackable Operator for Apache NiFi

This is a Kubernetes Operator to manage Apache NiFi clusters.

It is written by https://www.stackable.de[Stackable] in Rust, and it is supposed to be used with the https://github.com/stackabletech/agent[Stackable Agent] instead of the Kubernetes kubelet.

The docs can be found in the `docs` subdirectory, and they are published together with docs for all other Stackable products at https://docs.stackable.tech.

== Building

This operator is written in Rust.
It is developed against the latest Rust release (1.53-stable at the time of writing this).

NOTE: This requires Rust nightly due to the use of the `backtrace` feature.

    cargo build

== Starting

In order to start the NiFi operator use:

    cargo run --bin stackable-nifi-operator-server

To run NiFi in cluster mode, a working ZooKeeper (Version >= 3.5) must be deployed.

As of now, the Stackable Operator for Apache NiFi only supports one NiFi instance per physical node.

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Use [config-utils](https://github.com/stackabletech/config-utils/) for text-replacement of variables in configs.
  This fixes escaping problems, especially when you have special characters in your password ([#627]).

### Added

- Support specifying the SecretClass that is used to obtain TLS certificates ([#622]).

### Changed

- Bump `stackable-operator` from `0.64.0` to `0.70.0` ([#641]).
- Bump `product-config` from `0.6.0` to `0.7.0` ([#641]).
- Make it easy to test custom NiFi images ([#616]).

### Fixed

- Processing of corrupted log events fixed; If errors occur, the error
  messages are added to the log event ([#628]).

## [23.4.0] - 2023-04-17

### Added

- Enabled logging and log aggregation ([#418])
- Deploy default and support custom affinities ([#436], [#451])
- Added the ability to mount extra volumes for files that may be needed for NiFi processors to work ([#434])
- Openshift compatibility ([#446]).
- Extend cluster resources for status and cluster operation (paused, stopped) ([#447])
- Cluster status conditions ([#448])

### Changed

- [BREAKING]: Renamed global `config` to `clusterConfig` ([#417])
- [BREAKING]: Moved `zookeeper_configmap_name` to `clusterConfig` ([#417])
- `operator-rs` `0.33.0` -> `0.40.2` ([#418], [#447], [#452])
- [BREAKING] Support specifying Service type.
  This enables us to later switch non-breaking to using `ListenerClasses` for the exposure of Services.
  This change is breaking, because - for security reasons - we default to the `cluster-internal` `ListenerClass`.
  If you need your cluster to be accessible from outside of Kubernetes you need to set `clusterConfig.listenerClass`
  to `external-unstable` ([#449]).

### Fixed

- Avoid empty log events dated to 1970-01-01 and improve the precision of the
  log event timestamps ([#452]).
- Fix `create-reporting-task` to support multiple rolegroups ([#453])
- Fix proxy hosts list missing an entry for the load-balanced Service ([#453])
- Remove hardcoded `kubernetes.io/os=linux` selector when determining list of valid proxy nodes ([#453])

### Changed

- Updated operator-rs to 0.31.0 ([#382], [#401], [#408])
- Do not run init container as root anymore and avoid chmod and chown ([#390])
- [BREAKING] Use Product image selection instead of version. `spec.version` has been replaced by `spec.image` ([#394])
- [BREAKING]: Removed tools image (reporting task job and init container) and replaced with NiFi product image. This means the latest stackable version has to be used in the product image selection ([#397])
- Fixed the RoleGroup `selector`. It was not used before. ([#401])
- Refactoring of authentication handling ([#408])

### Changed

- `operator-rs` `0.10.0` -> `0.15.0` ([#218], [#223], [#230]).

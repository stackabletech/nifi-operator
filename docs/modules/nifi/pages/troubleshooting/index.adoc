== Usage of EmptyDir volume "log" exceeds the limit

This error is caused by Logback only checking every 60 seconds ("checkIncrement") if log rotation should be triggered and causing the log file to become larger than the `log` Volume attached to NiFi Pods.
Starting with SDP 24.11 `checkIncrement` is set to 5 seconds in the Logback config and size of the `log` Volume attached to NiFi Pods has been increased from 33 MiB to 500 MiB.

If you still encounter this error in rare cases of very high load on NiFi you can further increase the `log` Volume size.

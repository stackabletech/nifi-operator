:description: Deploy Apache NiFi on Kubernetes using manifest files. Verify setup and access NiFi's web interface with stackablectl or kubectl.

After going through the xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[] section and having installed all the operators, you deploy a NiFi cluster and the required dependencies.
Afterward you can <<_verify_that_it_works, verify that it works>> by querying the REST API.

== Setup

We are going to install a NiFi cluster by applying a manifest file.
The operators create the resources according to the manifests.

The NiFi cluster requires authentication.
Create a set of credentials for this purpose:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=install-nifi-credentials]
----

Afterwards create a NiFi instance:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=install-nifi]
----

== Verify that it works

First, make sure all pods are ready:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=wait-nifi-rollout]
----

Then make sure the StatefulSets are ready:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get statefulset
----

The output should show all pods ready:

[source]
----
NAME                                 READY   AGE
broken-nifi-node-default             2/2     5m
simple-zk-server-default             3/3     7m
----

Congratulations! You successfully created your first NiFi cluster!

=== Access the NiFi web interface

You can retrieve the URL for the NiFi cluster web interface via `stackablectl` or `kubectl`.

==== stackablectl

Use the service command of `stackablectl` to get a list of all available endpoints:

[source,bash]
----
stackablectl stacklet list
----

which should return something like this:

----
 PRODUCT    NAME         NAMESPACE  ENDPOINTS                           CONDITIONS
 nifi       broken-nifi  default    node-https https://172.18.0.2:30528 Available, Reconciling, Running
----

You can also use the `json` output and parse the endpoint:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=stackablectl-nifi-url]
----

Then connect to `https://172.18.0.2:30528/nifi` and you should see the NiFi web login. After providing the username `admin` and password `admin` you are redirected to the NiFi web interface.

==== Via kubectl

You can also extract the endpoint from the xref:listener-operator:listener.adoc[Listener] status via `kubectl`:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=get-nifi-url]
----

should output a URL to connect to the NiFi web interface:

[source]
----
NiFi URL: https://172.18.0.2:30528
----

Then connect to `https://172.18.0.2:30528/nifi` and you should see the NiFi web login. After providing the username `admin` and password `admin` you are redirected to the NiFi web interface.

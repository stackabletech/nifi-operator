= First steps

After going through the xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[] section and having installed all the operators, you will now deploy a NiFi cluster and the required dependencies. Afterwards you can <<_verify_that_it_works, verify that it works>> by querying the REST API.

== Setup

Two things need to be installed to create a NiFi cluster:

* A ZooKeeper cluster for internal use by NiFi
* The NiFi cluster itself

We will create them in this order, each one is created by applying a manifest file. The operators you just installed will then create the resources according to the manifest.

=== Apache ZooKeeper

To create a ZooKeeper instance run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=install-zookeeper]
----

Create a Znode object:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=install-znode]
----

The xref:zookeeper:znodes.adoc[ZNode] makes sure that the NiFi cluster will operate in its own separated directory in ZooKeeper.

=== Apache NiFi

The NiFi cluster requires authentication. Create a set of credentials for this purpose:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=install-nifi-credentials]
----

Finally create a NiFi instance:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=install-nifi]
----

== Verify that it works

First, make sure all pods are ready:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=wait-nifi-rollout]
----

Then make sure the StatefulSets are ready:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get statefulset
----

The output should show all pods ready:

[source]
----
NAME                                 READY   AGE
simple-nifi-node-default             2/2     5m
simple-zk-server-default             3/3     7m
----

Congratulations! You successfully created your first NiFi cluster!

=== Access the NiFi web interface

You can retrieve the URL for the NiFi cluster web interface via `stackablectl` or `kubectl`.

==== stackablectl

Use the service command of `stackablectl` to get a list of all available endpoints:

[source,bash]
----
stackablectl svc list
----

which should return something like this:

----
 PRODUCT    NAME         NAMESPACE  ENDPOINTS                       EXTRA INFOS

 nifi       simple-nifi  default    https https://172.18.0.3:32595

 zookeeper  simple-zk    default    zk    172.18.0.3:30173
----

You can also use the `json` output and parse the endpoint:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=stackablectl-nifi-url]
----

Then connect to `https://172.18.0.3:32595/nifi` and you should see the NiFi web login. After providing the username `admin` and password `admin` you are redirected to the NiFi web interface.

==== Via kubectl

Extracting the IP and port via `kubectl` is cumbersome. We recommend using `stackablectl` instead. The following `kubectl` commands store their output for further use in a variable and write its content to stdout afterwards. Make sure to run these commands in the same terminal:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=get-nifi-node-name]
----

which should output a single node name where a NiFi pod is scheduled:

[source]
----
NodeName: kind-worker
----

Retrieve the IP of that node:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=get-nifi-node-ip-internal]
----

which should output the internal IP of that node:

[source]
----
NodeIp: 172.18.0.3
----

You might need to replace `InternalIP` with `ExternalIP` depending on how you connect to your Kubernetes cluster.

Finally, retrieve the NodePort of the `simple-nifi` service:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=get-nifi-service-port]
----

which should output the NodePort:

[source]
----
NodePort: 32595
----

Now build the full URL:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=create-nifi-url]
----

which should output a URL to connect to the NiFi web interface:

[source]
----
NiFi web interface: https://172.18.0.3:32595
----

Then connect to `https://172.18.0.3:32595/nifi` and you should see the NiFi web login. After providing the username `admin` and password `admin` you are redirected to the NiFi web interface.

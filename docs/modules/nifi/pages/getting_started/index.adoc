= Getting started

This guide will get you started with Apache NiFi using the Stackable operator. It will guide you through the installation of the operator and its dependencies, setting up your first NiFi cluster.

== Prerequisites

You will need:

* a Kubernetes cluster
* kubectl
* optional: Helm

Resource sizing depends on cluster type(s), usage and scope, but as a starting point we recommend a minimum of the following resources for this operator:

* 0.2 cores (e.g. i5 or similar)
* 256MB RAM

== Usage of EmptyDir volume "log" exceeds the limit

This error is caused by Logback only checking every 60s ("checkIncrement") if log rotation should be triggered and causing the log file to become larger than the `log` Volume attached to NiFi Pods.
Starting with SDP 24.11 `checkIncrement` is set to 5s in the Logback config and size of the `log` Volume attached to NiFi Pods has been increased from 33MB to 500MB.

If you still encounter this error in rare cases of very high load on NiFi you can further increase the `log` Volume size.

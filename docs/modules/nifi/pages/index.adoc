This operator manages {nifi}[Apache NiFi] clusters on Kubernetes.
Apache NiFi is an open-source data integration tool that provides a web-based interface for designing, monitoring and managing data flows between various systems and devices, using a visual programming approach.
It supports a wide range of data sources, formats and features such as data provenance, security and clustering.

== Getting started

Get started with Apache NiFi and the Stackable operator by following the xref:getting_started/index.adoc[] guide.
It will guide you through the xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[installation] process and xref:getting_started/first_steps.adoc[connect] to the NiFi web interface.
Afterwards have a look at the xref:usage_guide/index.adoc[] to learn how to configure your NiFi instance to your needs or run some <<demos, demos>> to learn more about using NiFi with other components.

== Operator model

The operator manages the _NifiCluster_ custom resource.
NiFi only has a single process that it needs to run, so the NifiCluster has only a single xref:concepts:roles-and-role-groups.adoc[role]: `node`.
This role can be divided in multiple role groups.

For every role group the operator creates a ConfigMap and StatefulSet which can have multiple replicas (Pods).
Every role group is accessible through it's own Service, and there is a Service for the whole Cluster.

== Dependencies

Apache NiFi depends on Apache ZooKeeper which you can run in Kubernetes with the xref:zookeeper:index.adoc[].

== [[demos]]Demos

NiFi is often a good choice as a first step in a data pipeline when it comes to fetching the data in various formats from various sources.
The xref:demos:data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark.adoc[] demo uses NiFi to fetch six different datasets in various formats.
The data is then ingested into a Kafka topic.
Apache Kafka is also xref:kafka:index.adoc[part of the Stackable platform].

The xref:demos:nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data.adoc[] and xref:demos:nifi-kafka-druid-water-level-data.adoc[] demo use NiFi in the same way, both demos showcase downloading data from web APIs and ingesting it into Kafka.

== Supported versions

The Stackable operator for Apache NiFi currently supports the NiFi versions listed below.
To use a specific NiFi version in your NifiCluster, you have to specify an image - this is explained in the xref:concepts:product-image-selection.adoc[] documentation.
The operator also supports running images from a custom registry or running entirely customized images; both of these cases are explained under xref:concepts:product-image-selection.adoc[] as well.

= Graceful shutdown

You can configure the graceful shutdown as described in xref:concepts:operations/graceful_shutdown.adoc[].

== Nodes

As a default, NiFi nodes have `5 minutes` to shut down gracefully.

The NiFi node process receives a `SIGTERM` signal when Kubernetes wants to terminate the Pod.
It logs the received signal as shown in the log below and initiate a graceful shutdown.
After the graceful shutdown timeout runs out, and the process still did not exit, Kubernetes issues a `SIGKILL` signal.

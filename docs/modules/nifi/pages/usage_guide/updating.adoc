= Updating NiFi
:description: Easily update or downgrade Apache NiFi on Kubernetes by changing the CRD version.

Updating (or downgrading for that matter) the deployed version of NiFi is as simple as changing the version stated in the CRD.
Continuing the example above, to change the deployed version from `1.27.0` to `2.0.0-M4` you'd simply deploy the following CRD.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nifi.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: NifiCluster
metadata:
  name: simple-nifi
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: 2.0.0-M4 # <1>
----

<1> Change the NiFi version here

WARNING: Due to a limitation in NiFi itself it is not possible to upgrade or downgrade a NiFi cluster in a rolling fashion.
So any change to the NiFi version you make in this CRD will result in a full cluster restart with a short downtime.
This does not affect the Stackable image version, this can be changed in a rolling fashion, as long as the underlying NiFi version remains unchanged.

== NiFi 2.0.0-M4

Before you can upgrade to `2.0.0-M4` you https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NIFI/Migration+Guidance[need to update] to at least version 1.27.x!

= Connecting NiFi to ZooKeeper

NiFi in cluster mode requires a ZooKeeper ensemble for state management and leader election purposes, this operator at the moment does not support single node deployments without ZooKeeper, hence this is a required setting.

spec:
  clusterConfig:
    zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-nifi-znode
----

Configuration happens via a ConfigMap, which needs to contain two keys called `ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS` with the value being the ZooKeeper connection string and `ZOOKEEPER_CHROOT` with the value being the ZooKeeper chroot. This ConfigMap typically is created by a ZookeeperZnode of the xref:zookeeper:index.adoc[ZooKeeper Operator].

= Monitoring

The operator automatically configures NiFi to export Prometheus metrics.
This is done by creating a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/[Job] that connects to NiFi and configures a reporting task.

IMPORTANT: Network access from the Job to NiFi is required. If you are running a Kubernetes with restrictive https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/[NetworkPolicies], make sure to allow access from the Job to NiFi.

See xref:operators:monitoring.adoc[] for more details.

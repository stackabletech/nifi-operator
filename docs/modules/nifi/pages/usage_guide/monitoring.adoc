:description: The Stackable Operator for Apache NiFi automatically configures NiFi to export Prometheus metrics.
:k8s-job: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/
:k8s-network-policies: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/

The operator automatically configures NiFi to export Prometheus metrics.
This is done by creating a {k8s-job}[Job] that connects to NiFi and configures a reporting task.

IMPORTANT: Network access from the Job to NiFi is required.
If you are running a Kubernetes with restrictive {k8s-network-policies}[NetworkPolicies], make sure to allow access from the Job to NiFi.

See xref:operators:monitoring.adoc[] for more details.

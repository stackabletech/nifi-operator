:description: The Stackable Operator for Apache NiFi automatically configures NiFi to export Prometheus metrics.
:k8s-job: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/
:k8s-network-policies: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/

The operator automatically configures NiFi to export Prometheus metrics.
This is done by creating a {k8s-job}[Job] that connects to NiFi and configures a reporting task.

IMPORTANT: Network access from the Job to NiFi is required.
If you are running a Kubernetes with restrictive {k8s-network-policies}[NetworkPolicies], make sure to allow access from the Job to NiFi.

See xref:operators:monitoring.adoc[] for more details.

== Disabling create-reporting-task Job

It can be helpful to disable the Job, e.g. when you configOverride an authentication mechanism, which the Job currently cannot use to authenticate against NiFi.

To achieve this use the following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    createReportingTaskJob:
      enabled: false
----

= Usage guide

This section will help you to use various aspects of the Stackable Operator for Apache NiFi.
For a general introduction into the operator follow the xref:getting_started/index.adoc[] guide.
Below is a general overview of some configuration aspects, have a look at the subpages for details.

The cluster is configured via a YAML manifest file.
This custom resource specifies the amount of replicas for each role group or role specific configuration like resource requests.
The following listing shows an example configuration:

== Volume storage

By default, a NiFi cluster will create five different persistent volume claims for flow files, provenance, database, content and state folders. These PVCs will request `2Gi`. It is recommended that you configure these volume requests according to your needs.

Storage requests can be configured at role or group level, for one or more of the persistent volumes as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config:
        resources:
          storage:
            flowfileRepo:
              capacity: 12Gi
            provenanceRepo:
              capacity: 12Gi
            databaseRepo:
              capacity: 12Gi
            contentRepo:
              capacity: 12Gi
            stateRepo:
              capacity: 12Gi
----

In the above example, all nodes in the default group will request `12Gi` of storage the various folders.

== Resource Requests

If no resource requests are configured explicitly, the NiFi operator uses the following defaults:

[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config:
        resources:
          cpu:
            min: "500m"
            max: "4"
          memory:
            limit: '2Gi'
          storage:
            flowfileRepo:
              capacity: 2Gi
            provenanceRepo:
              capacity: 2Gi
            databaseRepo:
              capacity: 2Gi
            contentRepo:
              capacity: 2Gi
            stateRepo:
              capacity: 2Gi

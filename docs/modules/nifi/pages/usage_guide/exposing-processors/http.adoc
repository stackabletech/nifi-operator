= Exposing HTTP processors
:description: Expose NiFi ListenHTTP processor by creating Service and Ingress objects, allowing external tools to trigger workflows or send data.

You can use the `ListenHTTP` processor to start a HTTP webserver and listen for incoming connections.

In this case `POST` requests are being send to NiFi, which acts as a webhook to receive data here.
You should also be able to serve `GET` requests by using the `HandleHttpRequest` processor, however this is currently not demonstrated in this guide.

== 1. Create `ListenHTTP` processor

Let's start by creating a `ListenHTTP` processor:

1. Set `Base Path` to an empty string
2. Set `Listening Port` to `8042`.
3. Set `Record Reader` to an `JsonTreeReader` and `Record Writer` to an `JsonRecordSetWriter` instance.
   This guide assumes that JSON documents are being posted to the listener. For other document formats, change the record reader and writer accordingly.

You should end up with something similar to

== 2. Expose `ListenHTTP` processor

Afterwards you need to expose the processor to the outside world.

For that to work, first create a Service object as follows.
In this guide, the NifiCluster is called `simple-nifi`. The name of the Nifi cluster must match the value of the `app.kubernetes.io/instance` as shown below.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: simple-nifi-listen-http # Update according to NifiCluster name
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: node
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: simple-nifi # Update according to NifiCluster name
    app.kubernetes.io/name: nifi
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 8042
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8042
----

In case you don't have an ingress controller, you can set the Service type to `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` instead and should be ready to go.
If you are using an ingress controller, an Ingress could look something like

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: simple-nifi-listen-http # Update according to NifiCluster name
spec:
  rules:
  - host: simple-nifi-listen-http.my.corp # Update to your host
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: simple-nifi-listen-http # Update to your Service name
            port:
              number: 8042

=== 3. Route 

First, create a `RouteOnAttribute` processor and connect it to the `success` output of the `ListenHTTP` processor as shown below.
Start the `ListenHTTP` processor.

The `ListenHTTP` processor should now generate a FlowFile for every incoming HTTP request.
You can test this by calling `curl --verbose --data '{"hello":"NiFi"}' https://simple-nifi-listen-http.my.corp`, you should get a `HTTP/2 200` response.

TIP: If you get a `503 Service Temporarily Unavailable`, this probably means your ingress controller was not able to
reach your `ListenHTTP` processor, it is probably not running or not configured correctly.

This should result in one FlowFile being queued, as shown in the picture above and below.

The next step is to handle different kinds of messages coming in, based on the HTTP path.

In the `RouteOnAttribute` processor, add a field called `/webhook/foo` with the value of `${"restlistener.request.uri":equals('/webhook/foo')}`.
You can replace `/webhook/foo` with whatever URL your HTTP service should be reachable.
This guide also added `/webhook/bar` and `/webhook/bak` in a similar way.

The `RouteOnAttribute` processor now has one `unmatched` output as well as one for every field you defined.
You can connect a processor for every HTTP path you routed on.

The result should look something like below and should allow you to consume many different HTTP `POST` requests.

== Kubernetes custom resource options

The cluster can be configured via a YAML file. This custom resource specifies the amount of replicas for each role group or role specific configuration like port definitions etc.
The following listing shows a fairly complete example that sets most available options, for more detail about the individual elements please refer to the table further down on the page.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nifi.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: NifiCluster
metadata:
  name: simple-nifi
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: 1.18.0
    stackableVersion: 0.3.0
  clusterConfig:
    authentication:
      method:
        SingleUser:
          adminCredentialsSecret:
            name: nifi-admin-credentials-simple
            namespace: default
      allowAnonymousAccess: true
    sensitiveProperties:
      keySecret: nifi-sensitive-property-key
      autoGenerate: true
    zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-nifi-znode
  nodes:
    roleGroups:
      default:
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/os: linux
        config:
          log:
            rootLogLevel: INFO
        replicas: 3
----

=== Node Configuration

[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
  roleGroups:
    default:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/os: linux
      config: {}
      replicas: 3
----
The `nodes` element is used to define how many pods with which configuration should be rolled out.
It is possible to define multiple groups of nodes, each with its own distinct configuration, every `roleGroup` has the following elements:

 - selector: a Kubernetes `Selector` to specify criteria that can be used to target nodes
 - config: The NiFi config to use for this group
 - replicas: How many pods to roll out for this group

=== Authentication

[source,yaml]
----
clusterConfig:
  authentication:
    method:
      SingleUser:
        adminCredentialsSecret:
          name: nifi-admin-credentials-simple
          namespace: default
    allowAnonymousAccess: true
----
All authentication related parameters are configured in the `authentication` element.

==== Authentication Method

Currently, the only supported authentication method is "SingleUser", which allows the definition of one admin user which can then access the cluster.
Specification of these users credentials happens via referring to a Secret in Kubernetes, this secret will need to contain at least the two keys `username` and `password`.
Extra keys may be present, but will be ignored by the operator.

==== Anonymous Access

NiFi can be configured to allow anonymous access to the web UI, this is turned off by default, but can be enabled via the parameter `allowAnonymousAccess`.
This setting is independent of the configured authentication method and will override anything specified for the authentication provider.

=== ZooKeeper Connection

[source,yaml]
----
clusterConfig:
  zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-nifi-znode
----
NiFi in cluster mode requires a ZooKeeper ensemble for state management and leader election purposes, this operator at the moment does not support single node deployments without ZooKeeper, hence this is a required setting.
Configuration happens via a ConfigMap, which needs to contain two keys called `ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS` with the value being the ZooKeeper connection string and `ZOOKEEPER_CHROOT` with the value being the ZooKeeper chroot. This ConfigMap typically is created by a ZookeeperZnode of the https://github.com/stackabletech/zookeeper-operator[ZooKeeper Operator].

=== NiFi Configuration

[source,yaml]
----
config:
  log:
    rootLogLevel: INFO
----
This is the actual NiFi configuration element.
At the moment only a very limited set of options is supported, but you can expect these to grow quickly over time.
Anything that is not mentioned here can be configured via configOverrides. This does not include properties for XML files like `state-management.xml`.

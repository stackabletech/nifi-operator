= Dependencies

== Stackable Agent

For now this operator works only with a special branch of the Stackable Agent: https://github.com/stackabletech/agent/tree/volume_mount_package_root_hack_for_nifi[volume_mount_package_root_hack_for_nifi]

In contrast to the other Stackable operators, the config properties overwrite the property files (bootstrap.conf, nifi.properties...) in the deployed Apache NiFi package structure. There is no extra config directory.

== ZooKeeper

The state provider is ZooKeeper.
Which means a reference to an existing ZooKeeper ensemble must be provided

Tested with version:

* 3.5.8

Not working with version:

* 3.4.14

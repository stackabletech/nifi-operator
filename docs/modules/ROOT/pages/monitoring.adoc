= Monitoring

As of now enabling monitoring in a running cluster is not possible. The same problem appears when trying to disable monitoring in a running cluster that already has monitoring enabled (https://github.com/stackabletech/nifi-operator/issues/53[53]).

== Important

You can start a new cluster with or without monitoring, but you cannot enable or disable the monitoring in a running cluster later on!

= Usage

If you are not installing the operator using Helm then after installation the CRD for this operator must be created:

    kubectl apply -f deploy/nificluster.yaml

To create a three-node Apache NiFi (v1.15.0) cluster with SingleUser authentication enabled apply the following to your Kubernetes cluster.

The admin credentials that you can then log in with are: `admin:supersecretpassword`

If you do not provide the admin user credentials the operator can auto generate a random password for you, if you enable this functionality.
You can retrieve this password by running the following command:

    kubectl get secret nifi-admin-credentials-simple -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode | cat - <(echo)

You may need to adjust this command if you change the configuration for `adminCredentialsSecret` in the example below.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nifi.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: NifiCluster
metadata:
  name: simple-nifi
spec:
  version: "1.15.0"
  zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-nifi-znode
  authenticationConfig:
    method:
      SingleUser:
        adminCredentialsSecret:
          name: nifi-admin-credentials-simple
          namespace: default
        aut
    allowAnonymousAccess: true
  nodes:
    roleGroups:
      default:
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/os: linux
        config:
          sensitivePropertyKeySecret: nifi-sensitive-property-key
          log:
            rootLogLevel: INFO
        replicas: 3
----

If you want to set a password for the initial admin user you can do this by applying the following object:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: nifi-admin-credentials-simple
stringData:
  username: admin
  password: supersecretpassword
----

You can create the ZNode config map referenced in `zookeeperConfigMapName` via (assuming there is a ZooKeeper cluster called `simple-zk`:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: zookeeper.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: ZookeeperZnode
metadata:
  name: simple-nifi-znode
spec:
  clusterRef:
    name: simple-zk
----

== Monitoring

The managed NiFi instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See
xref:home::monitoring.adoc[] for more details.

== Configuration & Environment Overrides

The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role).

IMPORTANT: Do not override port numbers. This will lead to cluster malfunction.

=== Configuration Properties

Currently, not supported for any file.

=== Environment Variables

Environment variables can be (over)written by adding the `envOverrides` property.

For example per role group:

[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config: {}
      replicas: 1
      envOverrides:
        MY_ENV_VAR: "MY_VALUE"
----

or per role:

[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
  envOverrides:
    MY_ENV_VAR: "MY_VALUE"
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config: {}
      replicas: 1
